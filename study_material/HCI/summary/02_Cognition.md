# Cognition and Perception

## Cognition
- **Cognition**: the mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, and so on, that are what the mind does. (Slides 6)  
- **Mind**: a system that creates representations of the world so that we can act to achieve our goals; controls mental functions such as perception, attention, memory, emotions, language, thinking, and reasoning. (Slides 6)  
- **Cognitive Psychology**: the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of the mind. (Slides 6)  

## Model Human Processor
- **Three subsystems**:  
  1. Sensory input subsystem  
  2. Central information processing subsystem  
  3. Motor output subsystem  
  (Slides 10)  
- **Limitations**: omits the body, context, emotions, and social aspects of human behavior. (Slides 11)  
- **Application**: can “calculate” how long simple tasks take; basis for GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection rules) and KLM (Keystroke-Level Model). (Slides 12)  

## Memory
- **Sensory Memory**: exists for each channel (iconic, echoic, haptic); information passes to short-term memory via attention. (Slides 14)  
- **Working/Short-Term Memory**: a “scratch-pad” for temporary information; accessed in ~70 ms, decays in ~200 ms; capacity of 7 ± 2 chunks. (Slides 14–15)  
- **Long-Term Memory**: stores everything we “know” (episodic and semantic); large capacity; access time ~0.1 s; forgetting occurs slowly. (Slides 14)  

## Situated Action
- **Principle**: human action cannot be fully captured by formal plans; must observe users in context. (Slides 19)  
- **Example**: Lucy Suchman’s Xerox PARC study on copier use laid groundwork for human-centered design and context-aware systems. (Slides 19)  

## Distributed Cognition & Extended Mind
- **Distributed Cognition**: cognitive processes and knowledge distributed across people, tools, and representations; distinguishes internal vs. external representations. (Slides 22)  
- **Extended Mind Theory**: technology (e.g., smartphones) can replace parts of mind/memory, shifting emphasis to good interface design. (Slides 22)  

## Embodied Cognition & Affordances
- **Embodied Cognition**: cognition arises from our brains, bodies, and bodily experiences; body influences the mind. (Slides 23)  
- **Affordances** (Gibson 1977): properties of an artifact that indicate possible uses; when good, no labels needed. (Slides 24)  
- **Perceived Affordances** (Norman): what users believe they can do with an object, guiding actions. (Slides 24)  
- **Types of Affordances** (Gaver 1991):  
  - Perceptible (e.g., door handle)  
  - Hidden (e.g., undisclosed menus)  
  - False (e.g., underlined non-link text)  
  (Slides 33)

# Perception

## Overview
- **Perception**: experiences resulting from stimulation of the senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch). (Slides 40)  
- Always a combination of **bottom-up** (sensory input) and **top-down** (knowledge, expectation) processing; best interpretation of stimulus. (Slides 42)  

## Visual Perception
- **Eye anatomy**: light → retina → optic nerve → brain; lens adjusts focus (accommodation); fovea is high-resolution region. (Slides 41)  
- **Helmholtz’s Unconscious Inference**: retinal image is ambiguous; we perceive what is most likely to have caused the stimuli via unconscious assumptions. (Slides 52)  

## Gestalt Laws (Bottom-Up)
- **Proximity**: elements close together are grouped. (Slides 61)  
- **Similarity**: similar elements are grouped and assumed to share function. (Slides 62)  
- **Common Region**: elements within the same closed region are grouped. (Slides 63)  
- **Continuity**: elements aligned on a line or curve are perceived as related. (Slides 64)  
- **Closure**: we perceive complete figures even when part is missing. (Slides 65)  
- **Figure-Ground**: we distinguish objects (figure) from background. (Slides 66)  
- **Common Fate**: elements moving together are grouped. (Slides 67)  

## Dark (Deceptive) Patterns
- **Definition**: design tricks leveraging cognition principles to induce actions not in users’ best interests. (Slides 72)  
- **Types**:  
  - Nagging: persistent prompts with no opt-out (e.g., notification permissions). (Slides 74)  
  - Obstruction: making unwanted actions hard (e.g., hidden unsubscribe links). (Slides 76)  
  - Sneaking: hiding or delaying relevant info (e.g., disguising ads as reviews). (Slides 78)  
  - Interface Interference: privileging certain actions (e.g., highlighting “keep driving” in rideshare apps). (Slides 80)

# Metaphors & Mental Models

## Definitions
- **Model**: simplified description of a system or process. (Slides 101)  
- **Mental Model**: what the user believes about a system, based on belief rather than facts. (Slides 101)  
- **Conceptual Model**: designer’s high-level description of system organization and operation. (Slides 101)  

## Mental Models in HCI
- **Alignment goal**: user’s mental model ↔ system’s conceptual & implemented models. (Slides 112)  
- **Levels**: from simple (child’s view) to advanced (expert’s view); use models as simple as possible, as advanced as necessary. (Slides 106)  
- **Support**: transparency, flexibility (accelerators, shortcuts), affordances, constraints, and mappings. (Slides 113)  

## Transparency & Flexibility
- **Transparency**: maintain external interface consistency despite internal changes (e.g., NFS vs FTP). (Slides 114)  
- **Flexibility**: provide alternative ways to execute tasks (e.g., copy-paste via mouse or shortcut; macros). (Slides 115)  

## Constraints
- **Physical**: limit operations by shape or placement (e.g., connector shapes). (Slides 120)  
- **Logical**: use reasoning to exclude solutions (e.g., only valid calendar dates). (Slides 121)  
- **Semantic**: leverage world knowledge (e.g., seat orientation in model kits). (Slides 122)  
- **Cultural**: rely on conventions (e.g., color coding); beware of cultural differences. (Slides 123)  

## Mappings
- **Definition**: relationship between controls and effects. (Slides 126)  
- **Types**: spatial (arrange controls like real objects), physical (mirror real behavior), cultural (conform to conventions), perceptual (resemble the controlled item). (Slides 127–132)  
- **Consistency**: use mappings uniformly to avoid ambiguity. (Slides 134)  

## Interface Metaphors
- **Purpose**: exploit familiar real-world knowledge to help users form mental models. (Slides 136)  
- **Noun-based**: known object properties apply to new object (e.g., folders). (Slides 137)  
- **Verb-based**: known actions apply to new activities (e.g., drag-and-drop). (Slides 138)  
- **Noun+Verb**: combined (e.g., buttons, tabs, wastebasket). (Slides 139)  
- **Limits**: can be restrictive, culturally biased, or hamper expertise and innovation. (Slides 140)  

## Errors & 7 Stages of Action
- **Mistakes**: conscious errors from mismatch between mental and conceptual models. (Slides 142)  
- **Slips**: unconscious errors from inattention, often in expert “auto” mode. (Slides 143)  
- **Seven Stages** (Norman):  
  1. Goal formation  
  2. Intention specification  
  3. Action sequence specification  
  4. Execution  
  5. Perception of system state  
  6. Interpretation of system state  
  7. Evaluation against the goal  
  (Slides 145)  
- **Gulf of Execution**: difficulty translating intentions into actions when mappings are unclear. (Slides 151)  
- **Gulf of Evaluation**: difficulty interpreting system feedback to assess goal achievement. (Slides 153)
