# Design Process

## Key Concepts  
- **User-Centered Design (UCD)**: iterative design process focusing on users' needs at each phase to create usable/accessible products (Slides 8-11)  
- **Human-Centered Design (HCD)**: ISO 9241-210 approach making systems usable/useful via human factors/ergonomics; enhances effectiveness, satisfaction, accessibility (Slides 11-12)  
- **Usability**: extent to which users achieve goals effectively, efficiently, satisfactorily in context (ISO 9241) (Slide 8)  
- **HCD vs UCD**: HCD emphasizes human nature (emotions) and all stakeholders (maintenance, sales); UCD focuses on end-users (Slide 11)  

## HCD Process (ISO 9241-210)  
1. **Understand** (Specify context of use): Identify users, goals, environment via observations, interviews, focus groups (Slides 13-15)  
2. **Define** (Specify user requirements): Translate findings into requirements, personas, antipersonas, scenarios (Slides 27-30)  
3. **Design/Implement** (Design solutions): Iterate prototypes—low-fi (sketches, paper) to high-fi (software, hardware) (Slides 34-68)  
4. **Evaluate** (Evaluate against requirements): Measure user interactions via quantitative (lab/field) and qualitative methods (Slides 108-120)

## 1. Understand (Context of Use)  
### Research Methods  
- **Ethnography**: Immersion in real environments; reveals unexpected issues (Slides 17-18)  
- **Interviews**:  
  - *Structured*: Fixed questions, closed responses (quantitative analysis) (Slide 19)  
  - *Semi-structured*: Mix of predetermined/emergent topics (depth + flexibility) (Slide 19)  
  - *Unstructured*: Open questions for novel insights (Slide 19)  
- **Focus Groups**: Group discussions leveraging dynamics; efficient but prone to social biases (Slides 21-22)  
- **Interviewer Effect**: Interviewer identity biases responses; mitigate via neutrality (Slide 24)  
- **Qualitative vs. Quantitative**:  
  - *Qualitative*: Inductive, holistic, small samples (saturation) (Slide 16)  
  - *Quantitative*: Deductive, controlled, large samples (Slide 16)

## 2. Define (User Requirements)  
- **Requirements Specification**: Functionalities/metrics reflecting needs (e.g., connection speed) (Slide 27)  
- **Personas**: Research-based archetypes representing user types/goals (goal-directed, role-based, engaging) (Slide 28)  
- **Antipersonas**: Define excluded users (e.g., security threats) to clarify scope (Slide 29)  
- **Scenarios**: Stories showing how personas achieve goals; include background, tasks, environment, challenges (Slide 30)

## 3. Design/Implement (Prototyping)  
### Low-Fidelity Prototypes (Elaboration-focused)  
- **Sketches**: Quick drawings to explore ideas (not artistry); communicates design (Slides 43-45)  
- **Storyboards**: Sequence showing states/transitions; grounded in personas/scenarios (Slides 46-48)  
- **Paper Prototypes**: Interactive paper mock-ups (static/dynamic); early user testing (Slides 49-53)  
- **Wizard-of-Oz**: Simulated functionality (e.g., hidden human controls voice UI) (Slides 54-56)  
- **Physical Prototyping (XR)**: Props/acting to simulate AR/VR experiences (Slide 69)  

### High-Fidelity Prototypes (Reduction-focused)  
- **Interactive Wireframes**: Clickable layouts (Figma, Adobe XD) for workflows (Slides 59-60)  
- **Software Prototypes**: Functional code (Unity3D, Android Studio); reveals implementation challenges (Slide 61)  
- **Hardware Prototypes**: Microcontroller-based (Arduino, Raspberry Pi) for physical behaviors (Slides 62-65)  
- **Digital Fabrication**: Rapid production (3D printing, laser cutting) for casings/mechanics (Slide 66)  
- **Prototyping Strategies**:  
  - *Horizontal*: Broad features across a scenario (Slide 36)  
  - *Vertical*: Deep functionality for specific features (Slide 36)  
  - *Rapid Prototyping*: Create illusion of final product (Slide 67)  

### XR Prototyping  
- **Tools**: Unity3D, Unreal Engine, A-Frame (web-based); physical props for AR/VR (Slides 68, 99)  
- **Research Tools**: 360Proto, XR-Director, ProtoAR for paper prototyping (Slide 100)

## 4. Evaluate (Against Requirements)  
### Quantitative Methods  
- **Lab Study**: Controlled interface comparisons; watch for unknown variables/ordering effects (Slides 109, 112-114)  
- **Field Study**: Real-world observation under natural conditions (Slide 109)  
- **Surveys**: Large-scale feedback (Slide 109)  
- **Experimental Design**:  
  - *Hypothesis*: Falsifiable statement (e.g., "New system faster than Zoom+streaming") (Slide 112)  
  - *Variables*: Independent (manipulated) vs. Dependent (measured) (Slide 112)  
  - *Validity & Reliability*: Internal/external validity; repeatability (Slide 115)  
  - *Study Designs*: Between-subjects (large samples) vs. Within-subjects (counterbalance ordering) (Slides 116-117)  

### Qualitative Methods  
- **Thematic Analysis**: Code transcripts → identify themes → review/report insights (Slides 118-120)  
  - Steps: Familiarize, code, theme, review, define, report

## Extensions & Critiques  
### Criticism of HCD  
- Major technologies (e.g., email, WWW) emerged without formal HCD; questions role in radical innovation (Norman, 2005) (Slide 124)  

### Design Thinking  
- **Definition**: Non-linear, iterative approach for "wicked" problems via empathy, reframing, ideation, testing (Slide 125)  
- **Properties**: Human focus, 3-7 step models, radical innovation emphasis (Slide 126)  
- **Process**: Inspiration → Ideation → Implementation (Slide 125)  

### Ideation Methods  
- **Brainstorming**: Group idea generation → thematic grouping → voting ("no bad ideas") (Slide 128)  
- **Worst Possible Idea**: Invert problems → list terrible solutions → reverse attributes (Slide 130)  
- **Ideation Hexagon**: Six tactics (generalize, combine, invert, amplify, reduce, alternate) (Slide 131)

## Process Models Comparison  
- Despite varied terminology (HCD, Design Thinking, Double Diamond), all models share core stages:  
  **Analyse → Define → Design → Finalise** (Slide 132)  
- Differences are primarily semantic/perspective (descriptive vs. prescriptive)
