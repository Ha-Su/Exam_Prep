Anyone interested in creating answers to the following questions???

**Cognition**

* How many chunks can working memory hold? How can this be applied to interaction design?  
* What does the Extended Mind Theory state? Provide an example.  
* What is *not* included in Human Information Processing? Name two aspects.  
* Critique Norman’s Human-Centered Design. Give an example of a well-suited and a less well-suited application.  
* Explain the two directions of perception (Bottom-Up and Top-Down). Describe them in detail using the example of the image [figure 13 from the lecture].  
* What does Helmholtz’s theory of unconscious inference state? Draw an example.  
* Name four Gestalt laws. Explain two and show design example applications.  
* Which two Gestalt laws are violated by this image? ["Keep Red Off Line" from the lecture]  
* What are affordances?  
* Name two and explain them using an image. [The image showed two white cups and a teapot]  
* Give an example of a false affordance.  
* What are constraints? Name two types. How are they related to affordances?  
* Name three dark patterns and explain two.  
* For each of the following images, identify which dark pattern is used. [The “Nagging” example from the lecture and the “Obstruction” example from the lecture]

**Design**

* What are the two types of errors, and how do they differ?  
* What is transparency?  
* What are the seven stages of action? Draw the graph from the lecture. What are the two gulfs? Relate the gulfs to the seven stages.  
* What are the four components of user-centered design? Name the goal of each. Provide one practical method for each component and explain it.  
* What are horizontal and vertical prototypes?  
* Explain the difference between “getting the design right” and “getting the right design.”

**Evaluation**

* The results indicate that the different levels of the independent variable had no significant effect on finger discomfort. Can one conclude from this that there is definitely no effect? Justify your reasoning.  
* Explain within-subject and between-subject designs. Name one disadvantage of each.  
* Explain the difference between a laboratory study and a field study.  
* Are data collected via a Likert scale quantitative or qualitative? Justify.  
* A new keyboard layout has been developed that places the most frequently typed keys next to each other. The development team claims this allows faster typing and reduces finger fatigue. This now needs to be tested.  
  * Identify the independent variable and name three possible values it could take.  
  * How can the dependent variables be measured?  
  * What experimental task could be used to measure the dependent variable?  
  * Formulate two hypotheses.  
  * Name one control variable, one random variable, and one nuisance variable.  
  * Should a within-subject or between-subject design be used? Justify.

**Fitts’ Law**

* How should a frequently clicked UI element be placed in a PC application according to Fitts’ Law? Provide justification.  
* Does this change for touch input instead of a mouse? Explain.

**Notes**
* A total of 90 points were possible.  
* When both naming and explanation were required, points were awarded for each.  
* In the exam, it is recommended to work very quickly, perhaps writing only bullet points at first to cover everything in time, rather than drawing pictures of cats.  
* The topics were divided into seven questions, roughly in the order they were covered in the lecture.
