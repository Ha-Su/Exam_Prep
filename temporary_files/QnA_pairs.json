    "question": "How many chunks fit into working memory? How can you apply this to interaction design?",
    "answer": "7±2 chunks. In interaction design, limit the number of items (e.g., menu options or form fields) to around seven per group to avoid overloading the user’s working memory. Use grouping or submenus if you need more choices. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"

  {
    "question": "What does Extended Mind Theory state? Give an example.",
    "answer": "Extended Mind Theory proposes that external tools and representations (like smartphones, notebooks, or maps) become part of our cognitive system. Example: relying on your phone’s GPS app instead of memorizing a route. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"

  {
    "question": "Criticism of Human Centered Design by Norman. Give an example for well- and less well-suited application.",
    "answer": "Norman argued that HCD often refines existing interfaces but rarely produces major innovations. It works well for iterative improvements (e.g., tweaking a website’s navigation) but is less suited for inventing groundbreaking products (e.g., the first smartphone). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}"
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain Bottom-Up and Top-Down perception in detail with the '13' example.",
    "answer": "Bottom-Up processing builds perception from raw sensory data (you see three horizontal and two vertical lines). Top-Down processing uses prior knowledge and expectations (you interpret those lines as the digit “13” or the letter “B”). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}"
  },
  {
    "question": "What does Helmholtz’s theory of unconscious inference state? Draw an example.",
    "answer": "Helmholtz’s theory says we make unconscious assumptions to interpret ambiguous retinal images by choosing the most likely real object. Example: a blue rectangle overlapping a red one is usually seen as a blue box in front of a red box, not a strange six-sided red shape behind. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}"
  },
  {
    "question": "Name 4 Gestalt laws. Explain two with example applications in design.",
    "answer": "Four laws: proximity, similarity, closure, figure-ground. Proximity: items placed close together (e.g., a label next to its input field) are grouped. Similarity: elements with the same style (e.g., buttons of the same shape) are perceived as related. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}"
  },
  {
    "question": "Which 2 Gestalt laws does the 'Keep Red Off Line' image violate?",
    "answer": "It violates continuity (the red segment cuts other lines abruptly) and figure-ground (the red element fails to stand out as a separate shape). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}"

  },
  {
    "question": "Name two affordance types and explain them using an image of two white cups and a teapot.",
    "answer": "Perceptible affordance: the cup’s handle clearly suggests gripping. Hidden affordance: clicking on the teapot icon might open a tea-ordering dialog, but no visual cue shows it until you hover. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}"
  },
  {
    "question": "Give an example of a false affordance.",
    "answer": "Underlined text that looks like a link but isn’t clickable is a false affordance. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are constraints? Name 2 types and how they relate to affordances.",
    "answer": "Constraints limit possible actions: physical constraints (e.g., a USB plug only fits one way) and logical constraints (e.g., jigsaw pieces only fit correctly). They work with affordances by preventing incorrect uses. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}"

    "answer": "Nagging: persistent prompts for permission (e.g., 'Enable notifications?'). Obstruction: hiding options (e.g., a hard-to-find unsubscribe link). Sneaking: disguising ads as content. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}"
  },
  {
    "question": "Which Dark Pattern is used in the 'Nagging' and 'Obstruction' lecture examples?",
    "answer": "The first is Nagging (repeated prompts without a decline option), the second is Obstruction (unsubscribe link hidden as white text on white background). :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}"
  },
  {
    "question": "Which 2 types of errors exist and how do they differ?",
    "answer": "Mistakes: wrong intention (e.g., misunderstanding how a feature works). Slips: correct intention but wrong execution (e.g., misclick). :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is transparency?",
    "answer": "Transparency means changes in a system’s internals don’t alter its external interface, so users aren’t disrupted. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the 7 Stages of Action? What are the two gulfs, and how do they relate?",
    "answer": "Stages: 1) Form goal 2) Form intention 3) Specify action 4) Execute action 5) Perceive state 6) Interpret state 7) Evaluate outcome. Gulf of Execution: gap between intention and available actions; Gulf of Evaluation: gap between system state and user’s understanding. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}"

  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the difference between 'Getting the design right' and 'Getting the right design.'",
    "answer": "'Getting the design right' focuses on building the interface correctly; 'Getting the right design' ensures you solve the correct user problems. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you conclude the opposite if no significant effect of IV levels on finger complaints is found?",
    "answer": "No. A non-significant result means you found no evidence of an effect, but you cannot prove there is no effect at all."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain Within-Subject and Between-Subject design and name one disadvantage each.",
    "answer": "Within-Subject: participants experience all conditions (disadvantage: learning or fatigue effects). Between-Subject: each participant experiences one condition (disadvantage: requires more participants). :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}"
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain the difference between lab and field study.",

  {
    "question": "Are Likert-scale data quantitative or qualitative? Justify.",
    "answer": "Quantitative: they assign numeric values to levels of agreement, enabling statistical analysis."
  },
  {
    "question": "A new keyboard layout has been developed that places the most frequently typed keys next to each other. The development team claims this allows faster typing and reduces finger fatigue. This now needs to be tested. \n a) Name the IV and 3 possible levels.\n",
    "answer": "IV: keyboard layout. Levels: QWERTY (baseline), optimized-layout A (grouped frequent keys), optimized-layout B (alternative grouping)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can dependent variables be measured?",
    "answer": "Measure typing speed (words per minute), error rate (mistyped characters), and subjective fatigue via a questionnaire."
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the experimental task to measure the dependent variables.",
    "answer": "Participants type standardized text passages for a fixed time; software logs speed and errors, then they rate fatigue on a scale."
  },
  {
    "question": "Formulate two hypotheses.",
    "answer": "H1: Typing speed is higher with optimized-layout A than QWERTY. H2: Finger fatigue is lower with optimized-layout B than QWERTY."
  },
  {
    "question": "Name one control, one random, and one confounding variable.",
    "answer": "Control: same sample text for all. Random: time of day when participants test. Confounding: participants’ prior typing experience."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should you use within- or between-subject design? Justify.",
    "answer": "Within-subject, to compare layouts on the same participants and reduce variability, mitigating effects with counter-balancing."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where should a frequently clicked UI element be placed in a PC application according to Fitts’s Law? Justify.",
    "answer": "Place it at screen edges or corners where the target effectively has infinite width or height, minimizing movement time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does placement change for touch input? Justify.",
    "answer": "Yes. On touch devices, edges still help but screen size and hand posture matter; place frequent targets within easy thumb reach rather than extreme corners."
