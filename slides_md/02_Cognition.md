Human-Computer Interaction : Cognition and Perception

<!-- image -->

- FIGURE 1.1 What's happening in Raphael's mind as he walks across campus? Each of the "thought bubbles" corresponds to something in the story in the text

## Cognition

Cognition are the mental processes such as perception, attention, memory and so on, that are what the mind does

## Cognitive Psychology

Cognitive psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of the mind

## Mind

The mind is a system that creates representations of the world so that we can act within to achieve our goals. The mind creates and controls mental functions such as perception, attention, memory, emotions, language, deciding, thinking and reasoning.

## Perspective:

Human as an information processing machine

## Based on:

- (a) the psychological knowledge at that time
- (b) a task-based approach to human-computer interaction

## Historically:

Disembodied view of cognition: 'I think therefore I am'

## The Model Human Processor

'The domain of concern to us, and the subject of this book, is how humans interact with computers. A scientific psychology should help us in arranging the interface so it is easy, efficient and error free -even enjoyable.' - Card et al (1983)

## Three core blocks:

- a sensory input subsystem
- a central information processing subsystem
- a motor output subsystem
- → Remarkably similar to how we generally partition the main elements of computers!

Problem : What is missing ?

## Usage:

Able to 'calculate' how long it takes to perform a certain task.

- → KLM (Keystroke -level Model)

## Memory

## Sensory Memory:

- a sensory memory exist for each sensory channel: iconic memory, echoic memory, haptic memory
- information is passed from sensory memory into short-term by attention

## Working / Short-Term Memory:

- acts as a 'scratch -pad' for temporary recall of information
- accessed rapidly (approx. 70ms) but also decays rapidly (approx. 200ms)
- capacity: 7+/-2 Chunks

## Long-Term Memory:

- stores everything that we 'know' ( episodic memory and semantic memory )
- Large capacity
- relatively slow access time (tenth of a second)
- forgetting occurs more slowly

## The Model Human Processor

'The domain of concern to us, and the subject of this book, is how humans interact with computers. A scientific psychology should help us in arranging the interface so it is easy, efficient and error free -even enjoyable.' - Card et al (1983)

## Why HIP is not enough:

- It is too simple -we are much more complex and cannot be represented meaningfully as a series of boxes, clouds and arrows
- HIP arose from laboratory studies. The physical and social context of people are many and varied and conspicuous by their absence from these diagrams
- HIP models assume that we are alone in the world. Human behaviour is primarily social and hardly ever solitary
- These model are very clearly incomplete as they omit important aspects of human psychology such as affect (emotions) and bodies

## Situated Action/ Context-Aware Computing

'I have proposed an alternative approach drawn from recent developments in the social sciences, principally anthropology and sociology. The aim of research, according to this approach, is not to produce formal models of knowledge and action, but to explore the relation of knowledge and action to the particular circumstances in which knowing and acting invariably occur '

## Assumption:

People don't just follow simple plans, we can't model human behaviour so we have to observe the user in context

## Result:

- study at Xerox PARC by Lucy Suchman observing the use of a copier machine
- created the ground work for human-centered design (will learn more in HCD)
- context was later modelled and included in interactive systems, particularly for mobile computing (will learn more in post WIMP)

## Distributed Cognition / Extended Mind Theory

Both the cognitive process itself and the knowledge used and generated are often distributed across multiple, people tools and representations.

## Distributed Cognition

<!-- image -->

- Ed Hutchins developed the theory of distributed cognition
- distinguish between internal ( human memory ) and external representation ( knowledge in the world )
- Extended/External Memory: e.g., navigating with a map or writing down notes
- Extended/External Process: e.g., speed display in your car or calculator

## Extended Mind Theory

- a theory presented by David Chalmers and
- technology (e.g. smartphones) are replacing parts of your mind/memory
- instead of remembering numbers and paths we use functionalities of the phone
- putting the emphasizes even more onto good interfaces with the technology
- → What role does the phone have in our social life now ? How should exams look like ☺ ?
- → What becomes an essential Skill ? How to use tools like ChatGPT?

## Embodied Cognition

'[the mind] arises from the nature of our brains, bodies, and bodily experiences. This is not just the innocuous and obvious claim that we need a body to reason; rather, it is the striking claim that the very structure of reason itself comes from the details of our embodiment... Thus, to understand reason we must understand the details of our visual system, our motor system, and the general mechanism of neural binding. '

- George Lakoff and Rafeal Núñez

- against the idea of Mind -body dualism of René Descartes, the mind is not only connected to the body but the body influences the mind
- 'This is why […] we understand warmth with affection; as infants and children the subjective judgment of affection almost always corresponded with the sensation of warmth, thus giving way to metaphors such as I'm warming up to her'
- cognition is grounded in bodily experience

## Embodied Cognition

'The affordances of the environment are what it offers animals, what it provides or furnishes, for good or ill' - Gibson , 1977

## Affordances

- James Gibson is best known in HCI for the concept of Affordances
- In simple: Affordances are properties or features of an artefact which indicate a certain type of usage
- Some affordances are grounded in our physiology/body/nature
- If the affordances are good, no labels are needed for easy/trivial functions
- Don Norman further revised the concept to 'perceived affordances':

<!-- image -->

'real affordances are not nearly as important as perceived affordances; it is perceived affordances that tell the user what actions can be performed on an object and, to some extend, how to do them…' -25

## Affordances

'The affordances of the environment are what it offers animals, what it provides or furnishes, for good or ill' - Gibson , 1977

In 1991, William Gaver, another notable designer, defined three types of affordances:

Perceptible -Perceptual characteristics of the object itself indicate what action possibilities are available and desired -e.g., a door handle. These obvious properties prompt users to use the affordance in an intended way.

Hidden -In user interfaces without obvious affordances, users often must rely on experience and/or trial and error to determine possible actions -e.g., they hover/click on suspected dropdown menus.

False -An object's characteristics suggest users can do something they can't e.g., underlined text that isn't a link.

Human-Computer Interaction : Perception

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Perception

Experiences resulting from the stimulation of the senses such as seeing, hearing, taste, smell and touch

## Visual Perception

How we perceive, understand and make our way through the world is critical to our existence as people

## Eye:

Our visual sense is sometimes dominating other senses (visual dominance)

## How do we see:

- light bounces off an object into our eye
- this light than hits the retina and results in stimuli that are transferred via the optic nerve to the brain
- the eye's lens is used to adjust the focus (accommodation)
- the fovea is the region on the retina along the optical axis

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Perception

How we perceive, understand and make our way through the world is critical to our existence as people

## Top-Down

Knowledge, Expectation, Culture, Experience, Memory

## Bottom-Up

Sensory Input: Sight, Hearing, Touch, Smell, Taste

Perception is always a combination of both (top-down and bottom-up) processing.

Best possible interpretation of the stimulus

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Visual Perception (Top-Down)

How we perceive, understand and make our way through the world is critical to our existence as people

What am / seeing?

<!-- image -->

## Bottom-up processing:

taking sensory information and then assembling and integrating it

## Top-up processing:

using models; ideas, and expectations to interpret sensory information

Is that something Ive seen before?

<!-- image -->

Jack Westin

Top-down processing: prior knowledge suggests that

( this may be a B" or '13"

<!-- image -->

## Bottom-up processing:

sensory information alone reveals three horizontal lines and two vertical lines

## Helmholtz's theory of unconscious inference

How we perceive, understand and make our way through the world is critical to our existence as people

- Image on retina is ambiguous
- Likelihood principle: we perceive the object that is most likely to have caused the pattern of stimuli we have received
- Unconscious inference: perceptions are the result of unconscious assumptions based on experiences we have had in the past
- FIGURE 3.14 The display in (a) is usually interpreted as being (b) a blue rectangle in front of a red rectangle. It could; however; be (c) a blue rectangle and an appropriately positioned six-sided red figure.

## Gestalt Laws of Perception (Bottom-Up)

The whole is other than the sum of the parts. -Kurt Koffka

- Gestalt Principles are principles/laws of human perception that describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns and simplify complex images when we perceive objects.
- The first Gestalt Principles were devised in the 1920s by German psychologists Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Kohler -who aimed to understand how humans typically gain meaningful perceptions from the chaotic stimuli around them.
- They identified a set of laws which address the natural compulsion to find order in disorder. According to this, the mind 'informs' what the eye sees by perceiving a series of individual elements as a whole.
- Gestalt laws can be seen as an example (sometimes in combination with top-down) of bottom-up processing explaining the way our brains make sense of incoming information starting from the smallest, simplest elements and working up to the formation of more complex perceptions

<!-- image -->

## Gestalt Laws of Perception

## Law of proximity

The principle of proximity states that things that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart.

This is a single group.

These are conidered as seperate groups

## Use in Design

In UX design we have used this law a lot of time, and you can see this law used almost everywhere. In below example, the labels are always placed near to the field text, so that user can perceive it as a single element.

## Gestalt Laws of Perception

## Law of similarity

The principle of similarity states that when things appear to be similar to each other, we group them together and we also tend to think they have the same function.

<!-- image -->

## Use in Design

In the below login form, the fields and button have the same size, but due to the different color of the button, we know that its function is different. Also in the description text below, we knew that the blue texts are links.

## Gestalt Laws of Perception

## Law of common-region

The principle of the common region is highly related to proximity. It states that when objects are located within the same closed region, we perceive them as being grouped together.

<!-- image -->

## Use in Design

In UX this law has dominated with the use of cards If you observe cards creates a specific region of information, even if other information is placed near to them.

<!-- image -->

## Gestalt Laws of Perception

## Law of continuity

The principle of continuity states that elements that are arranged on a line or curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on the line or curve.

<!-- image -->

## Use in Design

In navigation, you can differ and understand primary and secondary navigation, In below, you can relate home, profile, shop, contact and help as a group of navigation easily because they are arranged in one line rather than home, profile, men, women.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Gestalt Laws of Perception

## Law of closure

The principle of closure states that when we look at a complex arrangement of visual elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.

<!-- image -->

## Use in Design

In design, this law is highly used to create negative spaced logos. Some examples are below.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Gestalt Laws of Perception

## Law of figure-ground

The figure-ground principle states that people instinctively perceive objects as either being in the foreground or the background. As a human, you can focus on either the foreground or the background.

<!-- image -->

## Use in Design

In UX design this law is used in the navigation panel, modals, and dialogs.

<!-- image -->

## Gestalt Laws of Perception

## Law of Common Fate

The law of common fate suggests that when multiple visual elements move in the same direction or at the same speed, we tend to perceive them as a cohesive unit or a single entity rather than individual components.

## Dark Design Patterns

Dark Patterns are tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something.

## How do dark patterns work ?

'When you use websites and apps, you don't read every word on every page - you skim read and make assumptions. If a company wants to trick you into doing something, they can take advantage of this by making a page look like it is saying one thing when it is in fact saying another.'

- → They leverage principles of cognition and perception to create a design that is optimizing not for what the user wants but what the business wants
- → More recent the term 'Dark Patterns' was replaced with Deceptive Design

<!-- image -->

Brignull defines ' dark patterns ' as instances where designers use their knowledge of human behavior (e.g., psychology) and the desires of end users to implement deceptive functionality that is not in the user's best interest.

<!-- image -->

Nagging

Redirection of expected functionality that persists beyond one or more interactions.

<!-- image -->

## Nagging

## Example:

The user is pressured to turn on notifications, and there is only the option for 'not now' and 'ok'. If the user does not want to turn on notifications, there is not option for that, and the app will continue to bother them about it.

<!-- image -->

75

<!-- image -->

Obstruction

Making a process more difficult than it needs to be, with the intent of dissuading certain action(s).

<!-- image -->

## Obstruction

## Example:

The 'Unsubscribe here' link is hidden as white text on a white background.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Sneaking

Attempting to hide, disguise, or delay the divulging of information that is relevant to the user.

<!-- image -->

## Sneaking

## Example:

Yelp disguises ads to look similar to customer reviews, and puts them in the same area as reviews are posted.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Interface Interference

Manipulation of the user interface that privileges certain actions over others.

<!-- image -->

## Interface Interference

## Example:

When a driver tries to stop for the day, the Uber app prompts them to continue in order to achieve an arbitrary 'goal' for the day. It even goes so far as to highlight the 'keep driving' option to make selecting it easier. This takes advantage of a person's natural desire to 'income target', or set a income goal for the day.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

What are the XR equivalents of these types of Dark Patterns and what 'new' Dark Patterns are possible ?

## Dark Design Patterns

Dark Patterns are tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something.

## Model

A model is a simplified description of a system or process that helps to describe how it works. [1]

## Conceptual Model

A high-level description of how a system is organized and operates (Designer Intention) [1]

## Mental Model

A mental model is what the user believes about the system at hand. A mental model is based on belief, not facts: that is, it's a model of what users know (or think they know) about a system such as your website. [2]

## Mental Models in HCI

<!-- image -->

## Mental Models in HCI

The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system - Forrester, 1971

## Mental Model and Conceptual Model

- A UI consists of a concept &amp; a presentation
- Always start to design the Concept first (conceptual model) and build the UI around it to explain the conceptual model to the user

## How to communicate and support the Mental Model ?

- Transparency
- Flexibility
- Affordances
- Constraints
- Mapping
- → Goal: 'Most simple model possible'

## Transparency in HCI

Any change in a computing system, such as a new feature or new component, is transparent if the system after change adheres to previous external interface as much as possible while changing its internal behavior. The purpose is to shield from change all systems (or human users) on the other end of the interface. - Wikipedia

<!-- image -->

No matter what the implemented model is, the mental model stays the same !

- Negative Example: FTP
- Positive Example: Network File System (NFS)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Flexibility in HCI

'Accelerators unseen by the novice user -may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions' [1]

An accelerator is a UI feature that speeds up an interaction or process.

- Keyboard shortcuts
- Macros (allowing users to link together certain actions, to be triggered via a single control)
- Touch gestures (e.g., long press, double tap, swipe)

Provide alternative ways to execute a task and include a variety of abilities and mental models !

- Copy Paste (shortcut)
- Copy Paste (mouse)

- In simple: Affordances are properties or features of an artefact which indicate a certain type of usage, often grounded in our physiology/body/nature

## Constraints in HCI

Affordances suggest the range of possibilities, and constraints limit the alternatives.

- Don Norman

Restricting the possible actions that can be performed ' Inverse ' of affordances, possibly augmenting them.

## Goals

Avoid usage errors

Minimize the information to be remembered

- → The absence of constraints makes things confusing

## Constraints in HCI: Physical Constraints

- Limit number of possible operations
- •
- Limit through e.g. Physical shape, such as Keys

or Placement, such as Controls not reachable by children

- Useful if constraint is visible ahead of time

## Example : Connectors

- Where do you plug in the mouse and the keyboard?
- Does the coloring help?
- How can this be improved?

## Constraints in HCI: Logical Constraints

- Use logical conclusions to exclude certain solutions
- Natural mappings often use logical constraints

## Example 1 : Jigsaw Puzzle

- all parts of jigsaw puzzle are to be used
- all parts only fit in logical way

## Example 2 : Calendar

- Only valid days can be selected

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Constraints in HCI: Semantic Constraints

- Use our common knowledge about the world and particularly the meaning of the current situation
- Powerful means to improve intuitiveness
- But: Only rules that are valid throughout your user population!

## Example : Sitting direction

- Driver's figurine in a model plane construction kit has to sit facing forward to make sense

## Example : Wheels of a Brick Car

- The position of the wheels and driver seat is known because you have the knowledge from real world examples.

## Constraints in HCI: Cultural Constraints

- Rely on generally accepted cultural conventions
- This applies only to a specific cultural group!
- Hand gestures are not interpreted equally
- Writing direction differs

•

…

## Example 1 : Color Coding

- Red mostly means stop or attention

Example 2 : Non-verbal Communication

- Hand signs might be different for various countries
- American Sign Language vs Deutsche Gebärdensprache

## Mappings in HCI

This refers to the relationship between controls and their effects in the world. Nearly all artifacts need some kind of mapping between controls and effects, whether it is a flashlight, car, power plant, or cockpit. [1]

## What are mappings?

- Connect functionality to UI elements/to the real world
- E.g. element for adjusting volume
- Map volume level to input control
- Map volume level to output
- Which control for input?
- E.g. On/off switch?
- Press button(s)?
- Joystick?
- Mouse?
- Slider?
- Which output for monitoring?
- E.g. Numerical output?
- Color?
- Size?
- Sound?
- Adjust slider position?

## Mappings in HCI

This refers to the relationship between controls and their effects in the world. Nearly all artifacts need some kind of mapping between controls and effects, whether it is a flashlight, car, power plant, or cockpit. [1]

## Different Analogies:

- Spatial Analogy : Arrange controls in the same way as the real-world counterparts are arranged.
- Physical Analogy : Mapping follows physical real-world behavior.
- Cultural Analogy : Mapping follows cultural conventions.

- Perceptual Analogy : The mapping looks/resembles the same look as the actual thing itself.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Mappings in HCI: Spatial Analogy

Spatial Analogies:

- Best mapping : Controls are mounted directly on the item to be controlled.
- Second-best mapping : Controls are as close as possible to the object to be controlled.
- Third-best mapping : Controls are arranged in the same spatial configuration as the objects to be controlled.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Mappings in HCI: Physical Analogy

Mapping follows physical real-world behavior

Example : Bucket

Rising level = more Falling level = less

- Natural for all additive dimensions e.g. amount (water level), heat (thermometer), volume, line thickness, brightness, weight, …
- But not for substitutive dimensions e.g. color, taste, …

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Mappings in HCI: Cultural Analogy

Mapping follows cultural conventions

Example : Writing directions

Western cultures write from left to right, so an arrangement from left to right can be used to convey a linear ordering.

But this might be not natural in other cultures!

## Mappings in HCI: Perceptual Analogy

The input device for controlling something (or output device for monitoring its state) looks like the actual thing itself

Example : Car Seat

## Use mappings consistently

## Strive for consistency!

## Negative example:

Ambiguous softkey mapping in this mobile phone

- Behaves as ' backwards ' in every application
- Serves as camera hotkey on the homescreen

## Interface Metaphors

## Example : Desktop metaphor

- Monitor is treated as if it is the user ' s desktop
- Objects (documents, folder, ...) can be placed and moved on this desktop
- Objects can be opened into a window (represents a paper copy)
- Objects can be moved to the recycle bin, the printer, ...

<!-- image -->

## Interface Metaphors

The interface (or a part thereof) is designed to be similar to a physical entity.

## Benefits :

- Exploit user's familiar knowledge, helping them to understand 'the unfamiliar'
- Helps users understand the underlying conceptual model
- Metaphors help users to establish a mental model
- Makes learning new systems easier
- Can be innovative and enable the product's access to a greater diversity of users
- Facilitate learning by making previously learned information applicable to new situations
- Metaphors can be based on objects ( noun-based ), on actions ( verb-based ) or on both

Interface metaphors are therefore a set of visualizations, actions, interactions, and processes that are based on or exploit knowledge of things that users already know from other areas.

<!-- image -->

## Noun-based Metaphors

- Make use of conceptual similarities between known and new objects
- Properties of a new object can be guessed by analogy to known object

## Examples :

- Folders have creation dates and owners
- An inbox contains new and unread information
- Warning signs

•

...

<!-- image -->

## Verb-based Metaphors

- Established and new activities may share conceptual similarities
- Exploit familiar description for new activities
- Outcome can be guessed by analogy to known activity

## Examples :

- cut and paste
- drag and drop

•

...

<!-- image -->

## Metaphors based upon noun+verb

- Transfer activities that can be performed on a known object to a new object
- Usage of a new object can be guessed by analogy to known object

## Examples :

- Wastebasket
- Buttons
- Checkboxes
- Tabs

•

...

<!-- image -->

## Limits of Metaphors

## Metaphors can be restrictive

- Expections may be falsely limited

## Mismatch between source and target domain

- Non-existing functions might be suggested

## Metaphors may be culturally biased

- Calendar, Trashcan, ...

## Ease-of-learning vs. ease-of-use

- Metaphors can hamper development of expertise

<!-- image -->

## Problems with Metaphors

Breaks conventional and cultural rules, conflicts with design principles

- e.g. recycle bin placed on desktop
- e.g. move documents or folders to recycle bin for deleting; move CD/DVD drive to recycle bin for ejecting

Too constraining: Can constrain designers in the way they conceptualize a problem space

- e.g. text search is helpful for opening documents, but not provided by original desks

Forces users to only understand the system in terms of the metaphor Designers can inadvertently use bad existing designs and transfer the bad parts over Limits designers' imagination in coming up with new paradigms and models

<!-- image -->

## Errors in HCI

The designer shouldn't think of a simple dichotomy between errors and correct behavior: rather, the entire interaction should be treated as a cooperative endeavor between person and machine, one in which misconceptions can arise on either side - Don Norman

## Fundamentally two types of errors

## Mistake

- conscious errors caused by a mismatch between mental model and conceptual model
- Example: Save file in cloud storage (through forced defaults in Win) and not being able to find it later
- Preventable only through understanding the users mental model

Slip

- unconscious error caused by inattention
- often happen to expert users since they operate often in 'auto' mode
- Example: Quick Save + Quick Load hotkeys
- Preventable through design choices

## 7 Stages of Action

We should ask ourselves:

- What makes things hard to use?
- What happens when someone uses an object?

## We can model this activity!

## 7 Stages of Action

We should ask ourselves:

- What makes things hard to use?
- What happens when someone uses an object?

## We can model this activity!

- → Norman's theory of action (1986): 7 Stages of Action

To do something, we must:

1. Formulate a goal: what do you want to do?
2. Execute an action: changing the environment
3. Evaluate the result: is the outcome the same as my goal?

<!-- image -->

This is a very coarse model - no 7 stages yet  Execution and Evaluation are more complex processes

## 7 Stages of Action: Goal Formulation

Goals are often very vague and problem-oriented

- I need more light
- Task level outside UI

They need to be translated into intentions

- Operate the light switch
- Semantic level of the UI
- … and then into concrete action sequences
- Turn around, stretch out arm, put finger on switch
- Syntactic level and interaction level of the UI
- … which are then executed
- Actually perform the actions

## Note:

Alternative intentions and action sequences are possible for the same goal.

Example :

- active vs. passive
- 'Could you switch on the light, please?'

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 7 Stages of Action: Evaluation

Evaluation also requires several steps:

1. Perceive the results
2. Interpret the meaning of the results
3. Compare the results to the previously defined goal

<!-- image -->

## 7 Stages of Action: Overview

In reality, steps are hard to distinguish

Complex tasks include sequences

- Hierarchies of goals
- Feedback loop

Goals are forgotten, discarded, changed

Many actions are opportunistic, not planned

- Meeting by chance leads to talk, deadline-driven work

Cycle can begin at any stage!

But what if something goes wrong?

## Gulf of Execution

Even 'simple' actions can be difficult → usability breakdown Reason : User cannot see how system works or what to do Connection between intention and execution unclear What is the problem? -often Mappings!

## Gulf of Execution

Even 'simple' actions can be difficult → usability breakdown

Reason : User cannot see how system works or what to do

Connection between intention and execution unclear

What is the problem? -often Mappings!

Does the system provide actions that correspond to the intentions of the user?

Gulf of Execution opens up through differences between

- The user's goals, and the available (or visible) possibilities to reach it
- Actions the user intends, and actions the system offers
- Actions the system affords, and actions that are actually possible

Ideally, the system lets users execute intended actions directly, without any extra effort

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Gulf of Evaluation

After executing the action sequence, the user needs to now whether the initial goal was reached

To do so, feedback from the system is needed: Missing or non-interpretable feedback → usability breakdown

Does the system provide visible feedback that is directly interpretable in terms of the intentions and expectations of the person?

## Gulf of Evaluation

After executing the action sequence, the user needs to now whether the initial goal was reached

To do so, feedback from the system is needed: Missing or non-interpretable feedback → usability breakdown

Does the system provide visible feedback that is directly interpretable in terms of the intentions and expectations of the person?

## Gulf of Evaluation opens up through

- Actual lack of feedback (e.g., there is no indication at all)
- Non-interpretable feedback (e.g., feedback is given, but the user can't understand it)
- The feedback does not match the intention/goal (e.g., feedback is given, but cannot be used to assess whether the goal was reached or not)

Ideally, system state is easy to perceive and interpret and matches user's conceptual model of the system

<!-- image -->

## Gulf of Execution and Evaluation

## Some Guidelines:

The model provides basic checklist of questions to avoid gulfs: 'How easy is it to…'

- Perceive system functions? (Intention)
- Determine executable actions? (Action sequence)
- Execute them precisely and without error? (Execution)
- Perceive the system state? (Perception)

1 '

- Map it to an interpretation? (Interpretation )
- To decide if the goal was reached? (Comparison)
