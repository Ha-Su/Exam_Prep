## Design Process

Human-centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques

## Task:

Imagine I ask you to implement and design a cloud-based service to allow students and teachers to have an online learning platform enabling teaching and learning in an efficient, safe, and enjoyable way.

Question:

How would you approach this ? What would you start with ?

Goal:

This week we want to look at processes and tools that should help you when faced such a challenge

## User-Centered Design

User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design process in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process. In UCD, design teams involve users throughout the design process via a variety of research and design techniques, to create highly usable and accessible products for them. [1]

## Human-Centred Design

User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design process in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process. In UCD, design teams involve users throughout the design process via a variety of research and design techniques, to create highly usable and accessible products for them. [1]

<!-- image -->

The term 'User' is removing the emotional side from the Human and hides the human nature and

The process should not only think about the 'end user' but actually every human involved in the process (maintenance, selling,..)

<!-- image -->

## Human-Centred Design Process

ISO 9241-210:2019 Ergonomics of human-system interaction -Part 210: Human-centred design for interactive systems

## Goal:

'Human -centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance.' - ISO 9241-210:2019(E)

## Properties:

- Iterative process with the human in the centre
- Focus on empathy and understanding the user within the context
- Human involvement in every step of the process (only conducting a user study is not HCD)
- Highly interdisciplinary teams (computer science, psychology, social science, design …)

## Specify context of use

'Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it' [1]

## Goal:

Deep understanding of the user and the context of usage

## Methods:

- Observations/ Ethnography
- Interviews (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)
- Focus groups

<!-- image -->

## Qualitative vs Quantitative Methods

'Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it' [1]

## Qualitative:

- Inductive
- Holistic analysis of a phenomenon ( → maybe develop a theory)
- Non-standardized measures (interpretation of the selected data)
- Often small sample sizes (saturation)

## Quantitative:

- Deductive
- Precise measure for one controlled outcome ( → maybe test a theory)
- Standardized measure (statistical analysis )
- Ideally large sample sizes

## Mixed Method

## Specify context of use (Ethnography)

'Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it' [1]

## Properties:

- Qualitative Method
- Researcher observes and/or interacts with subjects in their real-life environment
- Example: I want to design a better online streaming solution for students and teachers. I observe the current behavior and try to immerse in each role for a while

<!-- image -->

## Tools:

- Participant Observations (documented via image, video or even written diary)
- Participant Interviews/Surveys

## When to use ?:

- Early in the design process
- Work well with very complex and/or critical problems

<!-- image -->

## Specify context of use (Ethnography)

'Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it' [1]

## Pro:

- Help to identify unexpected issues
- Get a detailed and faithful representation of user behavior

## Con:

- Participants may not behave natural if someone is around
- Researcher may even impact some of the behaviour through his/her actions

<!-- image -->

## Specify context of use (Interviews)

'Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it' [1]

## Structured:

- All questions are created in advance
- Every participant gets the same order of questions
- Closed Questions (e.g., 'yes' or 'no,' 'male' or 'female', Likert)

## Semi-Structured:

- Only parts of the interviews are created in advance
- A combination of structured and unstructured
- Participants may bring up interesting topics that the interviewer focuses
- → This results often in a rework of the initial set of questions

## Unstructured:

- Goal of a free flowing conversation to uncover aspects you could have not thought of before
- Open Questions (e.g., can you tell me how happy you feel right now?)

<!-- image -->

## Specify context of use (Interviews)

'Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it' [1]

## Structured:

- Pro:
- Large amount of data can be collected for a low cost
- Quantitative data that can be further used in statistical analysis
- Con:
- Lack of detail or unexpected response.

<!-- image -->

## Unstructured:

- Pro:
- More flexible and can include concepts that are just discovered inside an interview
- Interviewer has the ability to ask and deeper understand (e.g., why, why not, how do you approach …)
- Con:
- Time-consuming and difficult to analyse qualitative data (e.g. grounded theory, thematic analysis)

## Specify context of use (Focus Groups)

'Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it' [1]

## Properties:

- Qualitative Method
- A group of participants is interviewed together
- Often times not a representative sample but a purposely selected group
- The interviewer's goal is to keep the group on topic

<!-- image -->

## Tools:

- Participant Observations (documented via image or video)
- Participant Interviews/Surveys

## When to use ?:

- Early in the design process
- Group dynamics could help to further explore a complex topic

## Specify context of use (Focus Groups)

'Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it' [1]

## Pro:

- Depth through open ended questions
- More validity since participants may feel more comfortable to discuss certain topics inside a group which is more natural behavior
- Less time intense then conducting multiple individual interviews

<!-- image -->

## Con:

- Sometimes difficult to keep participants on topic
- Social dynamics could negatively impact the results (e.g., shy people may not speak up, people could have false statements to impress other participants…)

<!-- image -->

## The Interviewer Effect

'Identify who the primary users of the product, why they will use the product, what are their requirements and under what environment they will use it' [1]

## Effect:

- Since the interviewer is also a human being in an interaction, his or her appearance may influence the perception of the participant
- Additionally, if exposed what the intention or the goal of the study is, participants may behave accordingly to please the interviewer

<!-- image -->

Example: In a user study exploring sexual harassment between males, a female interview could bias the sample since some participants may feel uncomfortable or even lie about their experiences

## How to deal with it:

- Choose the interviewer as neutral as possible
- Train the interviewer to be as objective and unbiased as possible
- Do not always disclose the proposed solution (if a comparison is done)

<!-- image -->

## Design Process

Human-centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques

## Task:

Imagine I ask you to implement and design a cloud-based service to allow students and teachers to have an online learning platform enabling teaching and learning in an efficient, safe, and enjoyable way.

## Step 1:

Immerse yourself in the context of use and the users. Become a teacher, a student and someone from the administration to understand what their needs are and how they use such a tool right now. Deploy techniques such as Ethnographies, Focus Groups and Interviews.

<!-- image -->

## Specify User Requirements

'Once the context is specified, it is the time to identify the granular requirements of the product. This is an important process which can further facilitate the designers to create storyboards, and set important goals to make the product successful.' [1]

## Goal:

<!-- image -->

Specify user requirements and functionalities that are important for the product. Emphasize the actual needs we found in phase 1 (Understand)

## Methods:

- Requirements specification (less used in research more in industry)
- Persona
- Scenario

## Example:

We found through our initial observations and interviews that it is important to connect fast to our streaming solution (functionality) and timing is important (measure)

## Specify User Requirements (Persona)

Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way [1]

- Helps to understand the users' needs, experience, behaviours and goals
- Helps to 'step out of yourself' (You are NOT the typical user !!, CS background, high education…)
- Different types of Persona (Goal-directed Persona, Role-based Persona, Engaging Persona, Fictional Persona)

<!-- image -->

Example for Engaging Persona:

## Specify User Requirements (Scenario)

User scenarios are stories which designers create to show how users might act to achieve a goal in a system or environment. [1]

- A Persona is often positioned inside of an actual user scenario
- Often focus on the most common use cases
- Structure:
- Background -who are your users (including their knowledge base and skillset/s)?
- Motivations -what goals do they want to achieve?
- Tasks -what must they do to reach those goals?
- Context of use -how will they encounter your design?
- Environment -where will they try to use it?
- Challenges -when they try to use it, what can get in their way (e.g., signal loss)?

## Rebecca's story

Music is a big part of my life; like to think that | always have a "background music" running in each scene of my gives me a lot of focus on my task regularly talk to my co-workers about music and singers thats what we like to talk about over lunch. Were constantly looking for new artists to inspire us and to expand our music library; but lately it seems a little tough to do that, Everything seems to have a "filter bubble" effect; and we keep listening to the same genres and artists.

really enjoy finding new artists that match my subjective taste, and most of the times get those from my close friends. wish there were a way to find more music and artists without having to rely on the serendipity of lifel to indicate how would interact with a product or service Finally; on the right-hand side some goals and concerns are shared; as well as a short scenario to indicate the persona's attitude. they

## Design Process

Human-centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques

## Task:

Imagine I ask you to implement and design a cloud-based service to allow students and teachers to have an online learning platform enabling teaching and learning in an efficient, safe, and enjoyable way.

## Step 2:

Use the data you collected in Step 1 to create Personas and Scenarios and write down the metrics that are important for the interaction (e.g. efficiency to setup the service, discoverability of features, easy to maintain for the administration…). These metrics will be used in Step 4 in the evaluation.

## Design (Wizard-of-Oz)

'Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.' [1]

## Properties:

- Create a 'façade' to give the user the illusion as if the system exists
- 'Fake' all the underlying functionality through a clever combination of existing technology

<!-- image -->

## Tools:

- A combination of functional technology to keep up the illusion, combined with acting and a wizard control panel

## When to use?:

- If you are interested in a certain concept/idea that arises from being exposed to the artefact that you try to WoZ and implementing it would take too much time.

<!-- image -->

## Design (Wizard-of-Oz)

'Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.' [1]

## Example:

## Properties:

- Starting to think how you would implement something
- Want to have a clearer understanding of the desired product and in particular the functionalities
- Often important when prototyping interactions or interactive aspects
- Often used to communicate with decision makers
- → Focus on Reduction (not always!)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Design (Interactive Wireframe)

'Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.' [1]

## Properties:

- Unlike storyboards, form builders use actual working widgets, not just static pictures
- Using appropriate tools you can quickly have a visually horizontal prototype and even add some verticality using simple 'scripting' techniques
- Only works for the software side of the prototype !

<!-- image -->

## Tools:

- One of the hundreds of tools offered specifically for that (Adobe XD, Balsamiq, Figma ,…)
- PowerPoint

## When to use ?:

- When you want to explore the visual design and the workflow of interactions

'Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.' [1]

Interface for users

<!-- image -->

## Design (Software)

'Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.' [1]

## Properties:

- A functional prototype that can be later used in a study
- Shows often what aspects of the implementation you underestimated beforehand
- Focus is here NOT on nice code guidelines but on fast results !
- Often times I 'reused' a different project that I found and build upon it
- → You do not have to start from scratch !

<!-- image -->

## Tools:

- Frameworks and programming languages that you are familiar with
- Unity3D, Android Studio, Visual Studio (WPF), …
- Example projects!

## When to use ?:

- When you found the right design but did not get the design right (yet)

## Design (Hardware)

'Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.' [1]

## Properties:

- Similar to the software prototype, the goal is NOT to have a product but a first impression of how the artifact will behave/feel
- Focus on fast results and break things (literally !)
- Often it is more efficient to combine already existing systems and only 'glue' them together using microcontrollers and duct tape

<!-- image -->

## Tools:

- Microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi,…)
- Breadboard, sensors, actuators and duct tape !
- Hacking ! If something that you want already exists, steal it and hack it !

## When to use ?:

- If you want to experience a certain physical behaviour

## Properties:

- Fabricate cases, connectors or actuators that you need for your artifact
- Often used if you need to combine two pieces of hardware or you need a certain mechanical behavior that does not exist yet
- There are different fabrication technologies (additive vs subtractive)
- Pipeline: Modelling Tool → Slicer Software → Fabrication Device

<!-- image -->

## Additive

- Stereolithography (SLA)
- Selective laser sintering (SLS)
- Fused deposition modeling (FDM)

## Subtractive

- Laser cutter
- CNC Mill

## Prototyping for Augmented and Virtual Reality ?

'Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.' [1]

## Low Fidelity:

- Design/Implement · Currently a HOT topic for researchers since there is a lack of understanding how to rapidly prototype in Mixed Reality and there is a lack of tools
- Physical Prototyping with real life objects (role play)
- Current tools for paper prototyping (e.g., Sketchbox)
- Research tools for paper prototyping (360Proto, XR-Director, ProtoAR)
- → Checkout Michael Nebeling at Michigan University (http://michael-nebeling.de/)

<!-- image -->

## High Fidelity:

- Currently the most dominant platform is Unity3D and Unreal Engine
- → Allows to have access to most lower level hardware functionalities (e.g. sensor data, video streams)
- A faster alternative could be A-Frame (web based AR/VR)

<!-- image -->

## Prototyping for Augmented and Virtual Reality ?

'Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.' [1]

## Physical Prototyping (No-Fi Tools)

- Use anything that you have to enable a brief understanding of the experience you are trying to achieve
- Instead of modelling anything in 3D use props that you have in your environment
- Instead of animating anything act it out

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Let's play a game. I show you a research prototype and you have to tell

me how you would have created a first low-fidelity prototype without programming !

Love it! The acoustic feedback is great. Typical Apple stuff with attention to detail. It just works.

Hmmm; why do feel downvotes incoming

It could also show others something of what you are seeing, if you wanted to share.

On a plane it could display instructions to the flight attendant so don't have to interrupt you to ask what you want to drink. they

It could be used to augment some wicked Halloween costumes.

## Prototyping for Augmented and Virtual Reality ?

'Based on product goals and requirements, start an iterative process of product design and development.' [1]

## Low-Fi Tools

- A good alternative to using Unity3D but still be able to have a first impression how something looks like in AR or VR
- Little to no programming necessary
- Still grounded inside of rapid prototyping tools that are build not for AR or VR
- Currently heavily researched by the community:

## Design Process

Human-centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques

## Task:

Imagine I ask you to implement and design a cloud-based service to allow students and teachers to have an online learning platform enabling teaching and learning in an efficient, safe, and enjoyable way.

## Step 3:

Create a large amount of different designs using sketching, paper prototypes and later first interactive wireframes and finally a first iteration of a potential tool using your computer science skillset. Iterate all of these prototypes that you created within the design team AND include stakeholders in very step.

## Evaluate

' Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.' [1]

## Goal:

<!-- image -->

Collect data on how a real user is interacting with the system. Metrics for evaluation are often derived from the requirements collected in the 'Define' phase

## Methods:

- Quantitative
- Lab study
- Field study
- Survey
- Qualitative
- Grounded Theory/ Thematic Analysis

<!-- image -->

## Evaluate (Quantitative)

' Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.' [1]

## Lab study/experiment:

<!-- image -->

A lab experiment is an artificial situation, created by and highly controlled by the experimenter, that typically compares alternative user interfaces or measures how usability varies with some design parameter.

## Field study:

A field study is a real situation, happening in the actual environment where people use the interface under consideration, and using real tasks (rather than tasks concocted by the experimenter).

## Survey:

A survey is a questionnaire, conducted by paper, phone, web, or in person

## How to Design a Lab Experiment

' Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.' [1]

<!-- image -->

## Task:

Imagine I ask you to implement and design a cloud-based service to allow students and teachers to have an online learning platform enabling teaching and learning in an efficient, safe, and enjoyable way.

## What we have:

Imagine we iterated through the hole UCD/HCD process and finally got a prototype that we want to evaluate in a user study. How are we going to do measure its efficiency, safety and how enjoyable the system is ? We want to design a lab experiment. How do we do it?

## How to Design a Lab Experiment

- ' Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.' [1]

## Hypothesis:

<!-- image -->

- Quantifiable, measurable and falsifiable
- Example: ' Our new system is faster to start for the teacher compared to the currently used system (Zoom + Local Streaming)'

## Independent Variable (IV):

- the variables you're going to manipulate in order to test the hypothesis
- Example: Our IV is 'System' with two levels (old and new)

## Dependent Variable (DV):

- the variables you'll actually measure in the experiment to test the hypothesis
- Example: Our DV is time measured in seconds from the first click until we have a stable connection locally and remotely

## How to Design a Lab Experiment

' Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.' [1]

## Controlled Experiment:

Manipulate the independent variables to understand the impact and relationship to the dependent variables. Watch out for unknown variables !

independent variables

Unknown Variables:

Example: What input device do participants use ? What past experience do participants have ? …

## How to Design a Lab Experiment

- ' Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.' [1]

## Users:

<!-- image -->

- Who do we recruit and how do we recruit ?
- → Most studies in (HCI) research are done with a student population sample

## Ordering:

- In what order are we presenting the two levels of the IVs to avoid learning effects or fatigue ?
- → Either use a randomized order or a counter-balanced order (e.g. Latin Square)

## Hardware:

- Control as much of the environment as you can
- → Everyone conducts the study in the same room with the same lighting/noise and with the same hardware

<!-- image -->

## Validity and Reliability

- ' Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.' [1]

## Internal Validity:

<!-- image -->

Internal validity refers to whether the effect we see on the experiment outputs was actually caused by the changes we made to the inputs, or caused by some unknown variable that we didn't control or measure

## External Validity:

External validity refers to whether the effect we see can be generalized to the world outside the lab, i.e. when those variables are not controlled

## Reliability:

Reliability refers to whether the effect we see (the relationship between independent and dependent variables) is repeatable. If we ran the experiment again, would we see the same effect?

## Between Subjects vs. Within Subjects

- ' Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.' [1]

## Between Subjects:

<!-- image -->

- We split our sample size in two groups and every participant only experiences ONE level of our IV
- One group uses only interface X, and the other group uses only interface Y.
- The performance of the X group is then compared with the performance of the Y group.
+   Avoid ordering effects and biases
-    We need a large amount of participants

## Within Subjects:

- Each user sees both interfaces, and the differential performance (performance on X - performance on Y) of all users is averaged and compared with 0
+   Less participants needed
-    Ordering effects and biases (can be mitigated using counter balancing)

## Evaluate (Qualitative)

- ' Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.' [1]

## Properties:

- Instead of having measurements of pre-defined metrics we record observations (video + audio) and interviews with participants resulting in a large amount of unstructured data Design/Implement
- We use different methodologies to structure, understand, interpret and make sense of the collected data

<!-- image -->

## Thematic Analysis:

1. Familiarize yourself with your data (Transcript)
2. Assign preliminary codes to your data in order to describe the content
3. Search for patterns or themes in your codes across the different interviews
4. Review themes
5. Define and name themes
6. Produce your report

## Design Process

Human-centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques

## Task:

Imagine I ask you to implement and design a cloud-based service to allow students and teachers to have an online learning platform enabling teaching and learning in an efficient, safe, and enjoyable way.

## Step 4:

Conduct multiple experiments with all the different stakeholders (e.g. students, teachers, administration) and evaluate if your new system is able to outperform the current state of the art in terms of metrics you found in step 2. Use quantitative and qualitative methods to not only find that there is a difference (quantitative) between the systems but also try to understand why (qualitative).

## Criticism of Human-Centred Design

' Most items in the world have been designed without the benefit of user studies and the methods of human-centered design. '

- Don Norman

<!-- image -->

## Lack of Innovation

'Show me an instance of a major technology that was developed according to principles of human-centered design, or rapid prototype and test, or user modeling, or the technology adapting to the user. Note the word 'major.' I have no doubt that many projects were improved, perhaps even dramatically, by the use of these techniques. But name one fundamental, major enhancement to our technologies that came about this way'

- Don Norman

## Design Thinking

A Wicked Problem is a "class of social system problems which are ill-formulated, where the information is confusing, where there are many clients and decision makers with conflicting values, and where the ramifications in the whole system are thoroughly confusing'

- Horst Rittel

## Design Thinking

Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test. It is most useful to tackle problems that are ill-defined or unknown . [2]

Th E

## Design Thinking

## Properties:

<!-- image -->

- Start with empathy (a deep human focus, in order to gain insights)
- Involves reframing the perceived problem or challenge at hand, and gaining perspectives, which allow a more holistic look
- There are a wide variety of process breakdowns and visualisations ranging typically between 3 and 7 steps.
- Original steps ( define, research, ideate, prototype, choose, implement , and learn)

## Usage:

A process that is tailored more towards 'wicked' or 'ill defined' problems. Focusing more on radical innovation rather than incremental improvement (vs HCD/UCD)

## Ideation Methods

Ideation is the process where you generate ideas and solutions through sessions such as Sketching, Prototyping, Brainstorming, Brainwriting, Worst Possible Idea, and a wealth of other ideation techniques.

## Goal:

The aim is to generate a large quantity of ideas that the team can then filter and cut down into the best, most practical or most innovative ones.

## Techniques:

1. Sketching
2. Prototyping
3. Brainstorming
4. Brainwriting
5. Worst Possible Idea
6. …

## Ideation Methods (Brainstorming)

Ideation is the process where you generate ideas and solutions through sessions such as Sketching, Prototyping, Brainstorming, Brainwriting, Worst Possible Idea, and a wealth of other ideation techniques.

## Goal:

At its most basic level, a Brainstorm session involves sprouting related points from a central idea. Brainstorming is one of the primary methods employed during the Ideation stage of a typical Design Thinking process.

## Steps:

1. Gather a group of 3-4 people
2. Define a topic
3. Everyone individually writes down ideas (e.g. Crazy 8)
4. Afterwards, everyone has to present each idea and others are encouraged to add similar ideas (NO BAD IDEAS)
5. Group the ideas by themes
6. Vote on ideas

## Ideation Methods (Worst Possible Idea)

Ideation is the process where you generate ideas and solutions through sessions such as Sketching, Prototyping, Brainstorming, Brainwriting, Worst Possible Idea, and a wealth of other ideation techniques.

## Goal:

- An ideation method where team members purposefully seek the worst solutions in ideation sessions.
- The 'inverted' search process relaxes them, boosts their confidence and stokes their creativity so they can examine these ideas
- Try to think about what made this specific idea bad in the first place, and can we revert it ?

## Steps:

Individually or inside a group

1. Come up with as many bad ideas as we can.
2. List all the properties of those terrible ideas.
3. List what makes the worst of these so very bad.
4. Search for the opposite of the worst attribute.
5. Consider substituting something else in for the worst attribute.
6. Mix and match various awful ideas to see what happens.

https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/worst-possible-idea

## Ideation Methods (Ideation Hexagon)

## Given the idea X what comes next ?

- (X d ) Generalize to another dimension
- → Flickr to Youtube
- (X+Y) Combine two ideas
- → Uber + Hairdresser
- (X up) Given a hammer find all the nails
- → App store for everything
- (X inverse)
- → Do the opposite with X
- (X++)
- → X + Adjective (e.g., faster, sustainable)
- (x down) Given a nail find all the Hammers
- → Alternative ways to solve the problem

## Design Process Methodology Comparison

Overview:

- In practice there are multiple types of design process (HumanCentered Design, Design Thinking, Double Diamond, IDEO,…)
- However, they all show substantial similarities
- When 'bent' to a linear structure and sorted into more general stages (derived deductively from the models), most process models easily fit the order of:
- analyse
- define
- design
- finalise
- they all use different terms for similar content and also their purpose varies from researching design itself to being an instruction on how to proceed in the design process (descriptive and prescriptive models)
