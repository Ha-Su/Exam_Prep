## Research question:

A statement that describes or explains a relationship between or among variables and is a proposal to be tested.

Therefore, need to identify variables and research question for your observation.

## What are Variables?

Characteristics or conditions that change or have different values for different individuals.

## Good and Bad Research Questions:

## 1) Questions Should Have Complex Answers (not just yes/no)

Bad: Does owning a pet improve quality of life for older people?

Good: In what ways does owning a pet improve quality of life for older people?

## 2) Good Research Questions Need Focus (not too generalized)

Bad: Does medication help alleviate attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms? And do kids need more exercise?

Good: How effective are the various types of medication in treating elementary students with ADHD?

## 3) Questions Should Be Specific and Precise

Bad: How do artificial sweeteners affect people?

Good: How does aspartame affect elderly women older than 70 who suffer from migraines?

Independent &amp; Dependent Variables

## Independent Variable (IV)

What is manipulated?

Relationship

IV refer to the factors that the researchers are interested in studying or the possible ' cause ' of the change in the depedent variable, i.e., variables that we change during

the experiment

## Examples :

- Type of Interaction
- Context

Measures

## Dependent Variable (DV)

What is measured?

DV refer to the outcome or effect that researchers are interested in, i.e., variables that we measure during the experiment

## Examples :

- Efficiency: task completion time, speed
- Accuracy: error rate
- Subjective satisfaction
- Ease of learning and retention rate
- Physical or cognitive demand

## Controlled variables

- What is held constant for all trials / participants.
- E.g., lighting conditions, room temperature.

## Random Variables

- What is allowed to vary randomly/uncontrolled.
- E.g., time of the day.
- Needs to have an expected relationship to IV

## Confounding variable

- What correlates with the independent + dependent variable
- Extra variable(s) you didn't account for
- Might suggest correlation when there isn't one

## Example:

Activity level (Independent Variable)

<!-- image -->

Potential Confounding Variables: Eating Habits, Starting Weight, Age, Occupation

Weight Gain (Dependent Variable)

## How can these be mitigated?

- E.g., Random sampling with huge sample
- E.g., Control for age (25-40 year olds)

## Hint:

Variables have a name and levels/values, just like in every programming language.

var name = a | b | c | d | …

## What is a hypothesis?

- A claim that predicts the outcome of experiment
- Concrete and testable statements derived from the research question
- •
- An experiment normally starts with a research hypothesis.. .. which is a precise problem statement that can be directly tested through an empirical investigation

## Experiment goal: Confirm hypothesis

- Approach: Reject null hypothesis (H0; inverse, i.e., 'no influence') by finding statistical evidence to refute or nullify the null hypothesis in order to support the alternative hypothesis Null hypothesis is a term from statistical testing: The samples are drawn from the same statistical distribution

A well-defined hypothesis clearly states the dependent and independent variables of the study

## Types of Experiments

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Evaluating with Users:

- Unlike the analytical methods, evaluating with users involves actual (or potential) users
- Participants should be representative (e.g., age, disabilities, …) for the identified target audience
- Requires more time but leads to deeper insights on how users actually interact with a something
- Allows studying effects for which no models/heuristics/etc. exist

## Controlled Experiment / Lab Studies:

A lab experiment is a controlled environment, that typically is used to isolate variables and establish causeand-effect relationships.

## Field study:

A field study is a real (or natural) situation, happening in the actual environment and using real tasks (rather than tasks concocted by the experimenter) to observe phenomena in their real-world context.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Within-Subject Design:

## Between-Subject Design:

- Each participant is exposed to all experimental conditions.
- Only one group of participants is needed for the entire experiment.
+ Smaller number of participants needed for the same amount of data.
+ Smaller influence of interpersonal differences. - Learning effects between conditions*
- Each participant is only exposed to one experimental condition.
- The number of participant groups directly correspond to the number of experimental conditions.
+ Simple Design
+ Low influence of fatigue (or other effects that appear over time)
- Large number of participants needed.
- Impact of interpersonal differences.
* For example: participant may perform better when subsequently completing the same tasks using another interface.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Counterbalancing:

- Learning effects between conditions*

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Solution: Counter-balance the order of conditions across the participants.

## Balanced Latin Square

The balanced latin square ensures that each condition will precede each other condition exactly once.

- Not all participants perform the conditions in the same order
- Not just : P1-P4: ABCD
- But rather: P1: ABDC; P2: BCAD; P3: CDBA; P4: DACB
- Learning effects are spread across conditions and cancel-out
- Also protects against carry-over effects : Something learned in a condition can be transferred to another condition.
* For example: participant may perform better when subsequently completing the same tasks using another interface.

Important: Balanced Latin Squares for odd numbers of conditions are 2n arrays! (e.g., n=3 results in 6 orders, n=4 in 4; n=5 in 10; n=6 in 6; …) 23

<!-- image -->

## How many participants do I need?

- Use tools to calculate/estimate your participants
- Tools need input that needs to be determined or estimated
- This can be hard and sometimes impossible, leading to the use of established, predefined values
- Not using such tools can lead to under- or overpowered study
- o Underpowered: too few samples to answer the research question of interest
- o Overpowered: too many samples show significances that are not relevant (effect size)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- You are not interested in individuals but in entire populations.
- •
- However, we usually cannot test the entire population

Example : 'Children are faster using system A' -&gt; We would need to test the system with all children on the planet.

That's why we need to sample parts of the population.

- We use this sampled group to perform tests.
- Based on the results, we make inferences about the underlying population.
- Significance tests allow us to determine how confident we are that the results observed from the sampling population can be generalized to the entire population.

Nominal Ordinal Interval Ratio Even though they can be expressed by numbers, they do not have a mathematical meaning

- Grades: 1 → very good, 2 → good, 3 → okay, …
- Is a 1 twice as good as a 2, and four times as good as a 4?
- This is because the distance between the elements is not necessarily equally distributed

We can further divide based on existence of a true 0

- Interval:  True 0 does not exist, the ratio has no meaningful interpretation e.g., pH of 3 is not twice as acidic as a pH of 6
- Ratio: True 0 does exist, the ratio of two measurements has a meaningful interpretation e.g., 10Kg is twice as heavy as 5Kg

Data can be Ratio or Interval based on the scale

- 40°C is not twice as hot as 20°C, 300°K is twice as much thermal energy as 150°K

## Quantitative Data Collection

Data collection in experiments is mainly achieved through

- (Automated) logging of data and measures
- Collection of data using questionnaires

## Objective data vs. Subjective factors

- For objective data, like accuracy, efficiency , … , use techniques to log or measure data  (mostly automated)
- For subjective factors, like ease-of-use, fatigue , … , use questionnaires to quantify the perception
- Subjective data can still be quantitative (e.g., measuring subjective perception of pain on a Likert scale)

## In real experiments both approaches are often used simultaneous

- During the condition data is logged, e.g., time needed for completion, accuracy, …
- After the condition participants fill in a questionnaire, e.g., NASA TLX, SUS, Presence-Questionnaire

## What to log?

## It depends on

- Research question
- Hypothesis
- Reproducibility
- Fail-Safety

Examples for ( Objective ) Measurements that occur very frequently are

- Task-Completion Time : Could even be divided into several sub-steps
- Reaction Time : Time till the user starts to react to the system
- Error Measurement : Measure of how well users performed their tasks.
- Movement Data : The amount of movement (total distance) or even the trajectory

Important: Decide for a suitable granularity: Everything or high-level data? In any case, also save raw data.

## Questionnaires:

Help to quantify subjective factors, such as ease-ofuse, fun, fatigue, …

## Questionnaires responses are measured on a rating scale

- Yes/ no
- Very Low, Low, High, …
- Likert Scale
- Custom Scales

## Either use standardized or custom made questionnaires

<!-- image -->

- Whenever there is a standardized questionnaire, use it
- When someone used a questionnaire to quantify same factor, use it or at least get inspiration

<!-- image -->

## Likert Scale

## Website User Survey

Named after Rensis Likert

Rather than asking questions, we measure the participants' agreement with certain statements:

- Ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree
- Typically in 5 or 7 steps, with a neutral middle
- Variants with even number of options forces participants to choose either positive or negative tendency
2. The website is easy to navigate.
3. The website's pages generally have good images.
4. The website allows users to upload pictures easily
5. The website has a pleasing color scheme

## Standard Questionnaires

Well evaluated and known questionnaires

How to assess whether a questionnaire is accepted?

- Look at who published it?
- Where was it published?
- How often was it cited?
- Was it used in previous related Work?

## Development of NASA-TLX (Task Load Index): Results of empirical and theoretical research

SG Hart; LE Staveland Advances in psychology; 1988 Elsevier

The results of a multi-year research program to identify the factors associated with variations in subjective workload within and between different types of tasks are reviewed. Subjective evaluations of 10 workload-related factors were obtained from 16 different experiments. The

## Custom Questionnaires

Capture additional aspects not covered by standard questionnaires and can be tailored to your experiment to be more specific.

Be mindful with your formulations!

## Bad Examples:

- No leading question: How great was your experience with our awesome system?
- No assumptive question: What made the interaction better?
- No double-negatives: Was the interaction no unfun?
- Poor answer scales: How many hours do you use VR in your daily routine? A) 0-1 hours B) 2-6 hours C) 7-14 hours

Remember also good and bad examples known from Research Questions.

- Experimental conditions
- Task description and procedure

3. Run a pilot study and re-iterate if necessary
4. Recruit participants
5. Conduct the actual study (incl. data collection)
6. Analyze the data

## Things to consider:

- Run pilot tests
- Don't waste participants' time
- Make sure participants feel comfortable and inform them about the study procedure and task
- Guarantee privacy
- Participants are volunteers ( consent forms required )
- Have a demographics questionnaire

## Hawthorne Effect:

- Participants of a study might change their natural behavior because they know that their behavior is being observed
- Most obvious in controlled (unnatural) settings
- But also applies to field studies in a natural environment
- Threatens external validity of study results

## Data Analysis:

After conducting a study and collecting data, the collected data has to be analysed in order to answer the initial research questions.

## Different Approaches

- Descriptives (Mean, Median, ..)
- Quantitative Data Analysis (t-tests, ANOVA, non-parametric tests, ..)
- Qualitative Data Analysis (Codebooks, ..)
- Plotting of Data (Boxplots, Histograms, ..)
- … etc

Required to identify statistical significance

<!-- image -->

## Descriptives:

Mathematical Summaries or Measures that provide an Overview of the Data.

- Mean: The average value of a distribution.

Adding up all numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are.

Not suitable for ordinal data that might not be equi-distant.

- Median: Middle value of the data.

Sort data in numerical order, then pick the element in the middle.

Also works for ordinal data.

- Standard Deviation and Variance: Measure of how spread-out the values are.

Variance = Average of the squared differences from the mean; SD = Square root of Variance

- Mode: Answers with highest number of responses.
- Min/Max: Minimum and maximum values of responses.
- Interquartile Range: Difference between 75 th  and 25 th  percentiles.
- Median Absolute Deviation: Median of all absolute deviations from the data's median.

Example Data: [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]

Mean: 2.67,   Median: 3,   Mode: 1

SD: 1.5,   Min/Max: [1, 5],   IQR: 4-1=3,   MAD: 1

Statistical Dispersion

Also works for ordinal data. For any further statement, we have to use quantitative analysis.

Standard Deviation and Variance: Measure of how spread-out the values are.

Variance = Average of the squared differences from the mean; SD = Square root of Variance

## Statistical Significance Testing and the 'p -value':

Significance testing allows us to quantify the chance that an event occurred just by random chance.

We speak of statistical significance when it is very unlikely to have occurred given H0 ( null hypothesis ).

## This probability is referred to as ' p-value ':

- A small p-value (usually &lt;0.05) indicates that the probability of a difference occurring by chance is very unlikely.
- Assuming that there are no differences in reality, p gives the probability of seeing this effect in the data by chance.
- This means: the lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference.

## In HCI, this is typically:

H0: All samples originate from the same population.

- That means: There is no difference in the data.
- If we can reject H0 based on our analysis, we say:

The probability that all of this data that we have seen belongs to the same underlying population is very low. Therefore, we assume that there is a difference between the groups.

## Different statistical tests required depending on Study Design:

| Design         | # of IVs   | # of Levels   | Parametric Test            | Non-Parametric Test          |
|----------------|------------|---------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Between-groups | 1          | 2             | Independent-samples t-test | Mann-Whitney-U-Test          |
| Between-groups | 1          | 3+            | One-way ANOVA              | Kruskal - Wallis test        |
| Between-groups | 2+         | 2+            | Factorial (n-way) ANOVA    | Scheirer-Ray-Hare test       |
| Within-groups  | 1          | 2             | Paired-samples t-test      | Wilcoxon test                |
| Within-groups  | 1          | 3+            | Repeated-Measures ANOVA    | Friedman test                |
| Within-groups  | 2+         | 2+            | Repeated-Measures ANOVA    | Aligned Rank Transform ANOVA |
| mixed          | 2+         | 2+            | Split-Pot ANOVA            | Aligned Rank Transform ANOVA |

HCI researcher are typical no statisticians nor mathematicians.

However, it is important to understand statistical concepts and be able to use established statistical analysis. Useful tools are : R, Jamovi , SPSS, Python, …

Note: You don't need to remember all of them, but to understand that there are different methods and that it depends on the design, IVs, and their number of levels. We will go into detail of two types of testing methods; namely t-tests and ANOVA.

<!-- image -->

## T-Tests:

T-Tests are statistical tests used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groupsand tests whether two sample sets follow the same distribution.

Consider the following example experiment ( within-subjects design ) with two conditions (C1 &amp; C2).

Some performance metric says, higher values are better.

First Intuition:

Condition 2 has higher mean than Condition 1 -&gt; C2 was better than C1.

- → Therefore, it is important to have t-tests ( or in general statistical methods ) to tell whether the two samples are from the same or a different distribution , i.e., there is an actual difference .

| Participant   | Condition 1   | Condition 2   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1             | -0,23         | -0,43         |
| 2             | 0,36          | -0,48         |
| 3             | 1,3           | 2,8           |

## T-Tests:

T-Tests are statistical tests used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and tests whether two sample sets follow the same distribution.

- →
- Different distributions assumed if the significance is below 5% ( p&lt;0.05 )
- again, which means, there is a significant difference!

(But also, that there is a chance smaller 5% that they are still from the same distribution)

(But also, that there is a chance smaller 5% that they are still from the same distribution)

Beware: T-tests -similar to other (parametric) methods -have a set of assumptions that must be fulfilled.

For t-tests:

- Continuous Scale (intervals or ratio)
- Homogeneity of variance
- Normal Distribution of data

## Assumptions for parametric tests ( not limited to t-tests! ):

There are two basic groups of tests. Parametric tests and non-parametric tests.

Parametric tests have higher power (i.e., it is easier to obtain significant results), but they have more rigorous requirements for the data (' assumptions ').

Whenever possible: Use parametric tests. If one of the assumptions is not fulfilled, then switch to the non-parametric equivalent.

## T-Tests:

T-Tests are statistical tests used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and tests whether two sample sets follow the same distribution.

## What about a third condition?

Naiive idea: Use multiple t-tests and compare pair-wise.

- → In the example, three tests ( 1-2, 1-3, and 2-3 )

Problem: Type I errors ( α -inflation )

| Participant   | Condition 1   | Condition 2   | Condition 3   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1             | -0,23         | -0,43         | 1,11          |
| 2             | 0,36          | -0,48         | 1,19          |
| 3             | 1,3           | 2,8           | 0,97          |

| 6             | -0,097        | 1,1           | 1,18          |
| 7             | -0,64         | -0,69         | 1,4           |
| 8             | 1,8           | 1,3           | 1,32          |
| 9             | 0,17          | 0,66          | 1,03          |
| 10            | -2,3          | 0,87          | 0,93          |
| Mean          | 0,1463        | 0,5628        | 1,1850        |
| Variance      | 1,3429        | 1,0939        | 0,0304        |

Single t-tests have a 5% error chance that would accumulate for multiple tests:

In the example: 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.86 = 14% chance of error!

## Statistical Methods might result in Errors:

As we are dealing with probabilities, there is the chance of making mistakes. Error accumulates for multiple tests.

- Type I error : A Type I error (also called an α error or a 'false positive') refers to the mistake of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true and should not be rejected.
- -&gt; rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.
- Type II error : A Type II error (also called a β error or a 'false negative') refers to the mistake of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false and should be rejected
- -&gt; not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false

Example: Court Hearing H0: The defendant is innocent.

|         |            | Decision Jury   | Decision Jury   |
|---------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|         |            | Not Guilty      | Guilty          |
| Reality | Not guilty |                 | Type | error    |

## Solution: General Significance test across all sample sets

Pairwise comparisons as a second step ( that also account for errors using correction methods, e.g., Bonferroni )

## Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA):

ANOVA is a statistical test used to compare the means of three or more groups or conditions.

## Different ANOVA variants exist:

- One-way ANOVA
- Repeated-measures ANOVA
- .. etc. (depending on the study design)

Also again, Assumption have to be met: Continuous data, Homogeneity of variance, Normal Distribution, and also Sphericity.

| Mean          | 0,1463        | 0,5628        | 1,1850        |
| Variance      | 1,3429        | 1,0939        | 0,0304        |

## General Procedure for statistical tests:

1. Check if assumptions are met.
2. Use correct statistical method (in this case ANOVA) to indicate significant differences.
3. If significance is found: Use post-hoc tests for pairwise comparisons.
4. Use error correction methods if possible.

Hypotheses

## Limitations for Experimental Research:

- It requires well-defined, testable hypotheses With limited number of independent (IVs) and dependent variables (DVs)
- Strict control of factors that influence dependent variables ( DV = measures )
- E.g., differences (DV) between age groups (IV)
- Lab-based experiments may not be a good representation of users' typical interaction behavior E.g., stress of being observed, different environment
- No matter how well an experiment is designed and conducted, bias and errors can never be completely eliminated
- Needs careful planning and time for conducting the experiment

Measures

Idea

Research Question

## Summary for Experimental Research:

- Is based on at least one testable research hypothesis and aims to validate it.
- There are usually at least two conditions ( a treatment condition and a control condition ) or groups ( a treatment group and a control group ).
- The dependent variables are often measured through quantitative measurements.
- The results are analyzed through various statistical significance tests.
- A true experiment should be designed and conducted with the goal of removing potential biases.
- A true experiment should be replicable with different participant samples, at different times, in different locations, and by different experimenters.
